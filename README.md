This is a template project for building fullstack Express.js/Next.js applications.

## Getting Started

First, install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Second, copy the `.env.sample` file at the root of the project and add your own environment variables. Be sure to exclude your `.env` file from git:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Third, run the development server and you should be good to go!:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
